 This repository is to showcase my undegraduate thesis project. I am working on a tactile sensor, an array, to be used for a myoelectric prosthetic hand.
 
# Tactile Array Sensor for Myoelectric A Prosthetic Hand
For my undergraduate project at Queen Mary University, I am working in a group to create an affordable myoelectric prosthetic hand for a trans-radial amputee. Many of the options currently available on the market are extremely expensive. We aim to create an alternative that is not only less expensive but gives users a sense of touch. This tactile sensor is made cheaply and can be easily replaced if issues arise.
